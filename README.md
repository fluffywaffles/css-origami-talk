# To move around in this project

You can use all the tags I have made. If you don’t know what tags are, no worries - just follow these steps:

Run `git checkout cube-starter` to get the “cross” that we folded into a cube.
Run `git checkout cube-complete` to get the completed cube with animations.
Run `git checkout mockup-starter` to get the starter code for the mockup we worked on.
Run `git checkout mockup-complete` to get the finished code for the mockup I left you with.
